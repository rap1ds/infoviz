\subsection{Sensory symbols}

\textbf{Sensory symbols} are symbols or aspects of visualizations that can be understood without learning. A meaning of the sensory symbols tends to be stable across individuals, cultures and time. Example: A cave drawing of a hunt.

Processing of sensory symbols is fast and hard-wired. They are resist instructional bias.

As opposite a \textbf{arbitrary symbols} must be learned, for example written word "dog".

\subsection{Instructional bias}

Because of instructional bias, we perceive a different line length because of the environment where the line is.

\subsection{Arbitrary symbols}

Hard to learn, easy to extend. Culture specific

\subsection{CIE system of color standards}

\subsection{Chromaticity diagram}

\subsection{Pre-attentive features ++}



Discuss pre-attentive features in design and use of glyphs

\subsection{Conjunction search of two pre-attentive attributes}

\subsection{PCA ++++}

What is the principal component?

Describe principal component analysis (PCA) in a suffient detail to understand the working ideas and principles

Descrube the properties of the visualization produced by PCA, and demonstrate the difference in resulting visualizations using a small toy example

\subsection{Curvilinear Component Analysis, CCA +}

True or false? CCA does not preserve small distances

\subsection{Cost function for CCA +}

Formula?

\subsection{Euclidean distance (between points)}

\subsection{Unity (CCA)}

\subsection{Depth Cue theory +++++}
Explain

List and explain depth cues

\subsection{Dimensionality reduction +++++}

a) Describe, define and discuss the measures that can be used to evaluate the "goodnes" of the projection.

What to take into account when choosing a method to use

\subsection{Precision (in dimensionality reduction)}

\subsection{Chart Junk}

\subsection{Gibson's Affordance Theory ++}

Affordance (ilmeisyys): Perceivalbe possibilities for action. Gibson said the "we perceive in order to operate". We perceive possibilities for action. 

Theory is attractive for visualization, because the goal of visualization is decision making. 

According to Gibson, affordances are physical properties of the environment that we directly percive.

1) Visualization is very abstract and indirect
2) No clear physical affordance: GUI button is very arbitrary
3) Rejection of visual mechanism

Influental theory?

\subsection{Active from the low-level point of view}

\section{Tentti 2010 - 03}

\subsection{Bad/good recall +}

\subsection{Bad/good precision +}

\subsection{MDS Multidimensional Scaling ++++}

Describe multidimenstional scaling (MDS) in a suffient detail to understand the working ideas and principles

Descrube the properties of the visualization produced by MDS, and demonstrate the difference in resulting visualizations using a small toy example

True or false? Multidimensional scaling preserves small distances

True of false? For MDS, the stress is always increasing with the projection dimension

True of false? MDS requires the coordinates of the original data to project (distances are not enough)

\subsection{Laplacian Eigenmap LE}

ToF? Projecting to one dimension using LE is enough to preserce the proximity coded in L

ToF? Projecting to two dimension using LE is enough to preserce the proximity coded in L

ToF? Projecting to three dimension using LE is enough to preserce the proximity coded in L

ToF? Laplacian Eigenmap does not work in this case

\section{Tentti 2009 - 05}

\subsection{Luminance and brightness +}

\subsection{CIE XYZ, CIELab and CIELuv +++}

\subsection{Image based object recognition ++}

Theory and implications in information visualization

People can recognice object from images remarkable well. If we show a pictures very rapidly (10 pic per sec), people are able to tell if there were a dog in one of the picture (Rapid serial visual presentation, RSVP).

Related phenomen: attentional blink, brains are processing still the first dog

Recognition ++ vs. recall --.

Objects are best recognized if they are in the same direction as they were initially seen. Also, opposite (silhouette) is well recognized

Priming effect: recognition is easier if prior exposure (altistuminen) to relevant information is given. For example, recognition of a horse is easier if picture of a cow is shown before horse.

Palmer et al (1981): Many objects have a canonical view from which they are most easily identified. We recognize objects by matching the visual information with "key views"

Implications:

Images easily recognized: Use icons

Priming effect: helping people search for particular patterns in data.

RSVP can be utilized for searching images from database (quickly show 10 images per second. This is a lot faster than scanning thumbnail grid)
